   Web application of a coffee shop is an online platform that allows ordering drinks and food from the coffee shop on the Internet. Users can browse through the menu, select the desired drinks and food, and then place an order. The ordered items can be picked up at the coffee shop or delivered to the home. The application also provides information on the location of the coffee shop, its working hours, discounts, and promotions. It is convenient for users who want to quickly and easily order their favorite drink or food without leaving their home or office. The application uses 3D models for each product.
